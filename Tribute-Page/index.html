        <h3>Quick Facts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Prototypes of modern numerals were being used in India as early as the
                third century B.C.E.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hindu scholars later transmitted their mathematical knowledge to the
                court of Caliph al-Mansur in Baghdad.
            </li>
            <li>
                Al-Khwarizmi’s book Calculation With Indian Numerals promoted the
                decimal system. He elaborated on concepts found in older sources,
                including Greek, Hebrew, and Hindu treatises.
            </li>
        </ul>

            Middle Eastern scholars] is immense and indisputable.”<br /><b>​​—Science

        <blockquote>
            “Modern Western numerals may be a conglomeration from different sources.
            However, as far as is known, the country that first used the largest
            number of these numeral forms is India.”<br /><b>—Britannica Online</b>​
